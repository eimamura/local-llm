- Code targets Python 3.11+, keep type hints where practical (see notebook tools) and favor concise, well-commented cells.
- Keep configuration in environment variables (`MODEL_NAME`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_TEMPERATURE`) loaded via `python-dotenv`; never commit real secrets.
- LangChain dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml`; use uv for installs instead of requirements files.
- Organize experimentation in notebooks under `notebooks/` and keep reusable helpers under `src/` if they grow.
- Prefer ASCII text and add short explanatory comments only for non-obvious logic (e.g., tool definitions, eval safeguards).
