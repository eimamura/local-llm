- Ensure README, notebook, and `pyproject.toml` stay in sync regarding environment variables, uv commands, and dependency versions.
- Validate the notebook imports by running the first few cells (after `uv sync`) to catch API drift.
- Confirm the local LLM endpoint (Ollama URL/model) is documented and defaults are safe.
- Run `git status -sb` before handing off work and mention any untracked/modified files.
